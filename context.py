Summary 
As I mentioned in the introduction, I was inspired to start my first company after talking to a friend who'd just gotten back from a trip to the Philippines and described the digital/mobile banking that was happening in that country, a far cry from anything I'd heard of at the time. I can't emphasize enough how important this conversation was for my entire professional and personal path, not to mention my forthcoming deep commitment to the startup world. So, the Philippines, while more distant t
The first time I applied for a visa to China, it was unceremoniously rejected. The form required me to input my employer's details, and I had naively written "BBC" (where I worked at the time). Apparently, that wasn't going to fly without some further explanation because the BBC, like other Western news outlets, was in a gray zone in terms of their ability to operate openly in China. But the company had a point of contact based in Beijing, and he could fix anything. (I always attributed it to hi
I flew into Sao Paulo in April 2023 for a few days before heading to Rio de Janeiro to speak at Web Summit, the European tech conference that was making its Latin-American debut. The startup scene in Brazil is centered in Sao Paulo, and it was just the excuse I needed to get back there to catch up with some of the founders my fund, Everywhere Ventures, had invested in and to meet new ones we might back in the future. One investing principle I take to places like Brazil is teaming up with the "sm
When I lived in London, many of my friends were from the Middle East‚Äîplaces like the UAE, Oman, and Bahrain, all of which I had very limited exposure to before I moved to the UK and therefore seemed far-flung and exotic to me. On the bank holiday weekends in the UK, I noticed that these friends would hop on flights back home for a quick visit and some sunshine, the way that New Yorkers head down to Palm Beach in February. I'd often be invited on these trips and had the opportunity to experience 
My role at the BBC took me to lots of places, and a favorite might be Australia, where I spent a large chunk of time immersed in the business culture, as well as soaking up that chill Aussie lifestyle, which was nothing short of a revelation for the Type-A New Yorker in me. A few years prior to me joining, BBC Worldwide had excitedly acquired the travel guidebook publisher, Lonely Planet, but by the time I arrived at the company, everyone was in a panic wondering what to do with it. Lonely Plane
Growing up in New York City, one of my favorite activities was going to the Egyptian Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I'd sit enraptured for hours after school, drawing the Temple of Dendur and other fascinating antiquities. I even made a model of the temple using sugar cubes for a class project in fifth grade. Thus began my fixation on the country of Egypt, and when I finally got the chance to visit the real place, all my (sweetest!) dreams came true. Around 2018, I was faced with a dile
My last trip, before the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily stopped me from my typical near-constant travel, was to the Middle East, including Israel. I'd gotten a call from Hilla Brenner, who was the Managing Director of the Techstars Tel Aviv program (the same job I'd had in New York until 2022), asking if I could join her "screening committee," a tradition at the company where other tenured MDs gather for two days to meet the current applicants and help select the most promising companies. Wheneve
I went to visit Barcelona for a weekend but stayed for a year. I'd been living in London, working for the BBC, and travel was part of my job. I was always on the road, and no one at the company ever knew where I was dialing in from. I was an early "global nomad," working remotely and traveling (Everywhere, of course) with my laptop in tow. I'd arrived in London in the winter, fell in love with it, and then "June Gloom" hit. I was decidedly unprepared. I assumed I'd be wearing shorts and summer d
Although my own family has been in the US since the 1890s, we never exactly lost that immigrant hunger and drive to make a better life. My grandfather‚Äîwhom I described in the introduction‚Äîworked all hours running his fruit stores and, for whatever reason, two generations later, I also share that professional hunger. I also touched a bit on my own startup journey. Back in the day, I had a roommate from Denmark whose boyfriend Mikael (who'd followed her from Denmark) often hung around our apartmen
For years, I'd been looking for an excuse to visit Kenya, and I finally had the perfect one with the Kauffman Fellows Global Summit, a four-day gathering with top minds in tech in the local ecosystem (founders and investors) and other business leaders and politicians interested in tech. The fellowship itself is a two-year program for people who work in venture capital, after which, fellows are able to attend the global summits with Kauffman alumni from all over the world. In 2023, the Global Sum
I had just shut down my second startup and was working on my next idea when I decided to take myself on a big trip, both for customer discovery purposes and for inspiration. For me, that means being in Everywhere-mode. Though I'd planned about fifteen stops in different places, I only got as far as NYC to London. I'd purchased a special around-the-world plane ticket, which at the time was only about $1,000 for as many stops as you want, provided you kept traveling in the same direction. My first
My senior year in college, not knowing what I wanted to do with my life, I applied to law school. But when it came time to enroll, I got cold feet and decided to defer and take a gap year in Mexico. I worked my ass off saving up and living at home, working nights and weekends at a popular French restaurant in the West Village (an interesting choice considering I was heading to a Spanish-speaking country) and as a production assistant on movies during the day. I don't think I slept for six months
If you've read the book Eat, Pray, Love, you already know the story of a heartbroken woman from New York City who shows up at an ashram near Mumbai, India, to "find herself." In my case, it was an Ashtanga yoga school in Mysore in South India. But it's a similar idea. As a type-A New Yorker, traditional meditation is tough for me. The idea of sitting quietly and concentrating on one thing runs contrary to the forty-two tabs I have open at any given moment in my computer's browser and the go-go-g

I'm sad when any of my early stage companies doesn't work out. But that's the job. I feel sick when one of my (now) series B/C companies shuts down. The sting is so much worse.

Two portfolio companies raising Seed. The one in Europe gets terms for $4/20m post from a top fund. Thrilled. The one in the US gets terms from top fund for $4/20m post. They are insulted. Both AI native with nice early traction. I guess a little water goes a long way!

Hard tech is hard, turns out SaaS is also hard (and maybe going away with AI) and don't get me started on consumer. Turns out startups are just hard. Find a problem space you are obsessed with and an incredible team and settle in for a bumpy ride.

Curiously, applications to U.S. law schools were up 33% in 2024 despite most of us agreeing that the legal industry is in the process of being significantly disrupted.

Founders in my portfolio have been raising their seed round since Jan 2024. They got close to a term sheet a couple of times but no. Then this week magic happens, a top tier seed fund agrees to lead. I probably would have given up long before these super gritty founders who made it happen.

The concept I'm being pitched the most right now by founders is agentic workflow apps for b2b. Funny to think this concept didn't really exist a year ago and now I'm seeing dozens every week.

Four of our portfolio companies got term sheet for $4-6m Seed rounds this week. Top funds. Feels like spring has sprung in fundraising land.

Doing a reference call for a founder with another fund manager. He asked me if I'd work for this founder? I never really got that question as a litmus test but I hear it a lot. Truth is, I don't want to work for anyone‚Ä¶

Sometimes the next generation at a family office are forward thinking, hard working pioneers. And sometimes they are just misbehaved + entitled. We've dealt with both over the last 7 years running our fund and it's hard to properly DD beforehand I must admit‚Ä¶

Caught up with an experienced founder raising a seed round. He talked to 10 quality investors but many pushed back on the GTM. The question is‚Ä¶does he stop fundraising and address the GTM issue or forge ahead knowing that if he talks to 100 investors, he will find a lead?

Unpopular opinion‚Ä¶ You can scale a company past 75 employees without hiring a full time HR person. Even more so today than when I was running my startup. Many smart people disagree with me on this point.

Just had another incident of getting mid way thru the DD process and only then finding out that the CTO is not full time and has another job. This is a deeply technical product. No idea why this was not flagged earlier?? Grrr.

The truth is that pre-seed valuations have not gone down much since the highs of 2021. I think being a seed investor right now makes a lot more sense.

I'm getting several supply chain / logistics pitches every week now. Many have traction and teams with experience. Some feel niche like they are addressing a link in the chain. A few are bolder sounding platforms. Anyone know why the space is so hot all of a sudden?

Let's just all agree to stop with the pre-money Safes. Not healthy for anyone and they always seem to stack.

Recently heard about an investor who actively tries to catch founders in lies during the due diligence process. What a strange thing to be known for?

If an investor doesn't think a startup is 'venture scalable', only thing to do is prove them wrong. Same thing for me, many LPs don't believe small checks work. Just keep building.

Wish I was joking but‚Ä¶ I needed to get the X-rays they took of my shoulder in the ER over to my orthopedist and they told me to come pick up a 'floppy disk' with the images. ER is Mt Sinai in NYC, they use Epic. Ortho is at NYU. Founders + investor, please keep investing in healthcare solutions - we need to fix this.

Here's a pro tip: If you're about to break up with your cofounder, pause your fundraise. Not disclosing this to potential investors is both material and dishonest. This behavior will 100% come back to bite you.

Corporate VC that was going to lead a round in a later stage climate company (not really energy related) just pulled out because of the uncertainty around climate tech. Wow, it's really happening people‚Ä¶.

Painful lesson that I learned as an early stage startup investor is that the exit environment is 10x more important than the entry.

So, yes, I'm hopeful that things rebound this year in tech, but I'm counting on 2035 to be a banger year!

I've been pitched 10 different AI agent companies just this week. All w/ super impressive teams and relevant experience. I have zero idea how to evaluate these opportunities? What an exciting and confusing time to be an investor!

Cold emails are fine. I read as many of them as I can. But lately I've been getting cold emails from a person that I don't know introducing me to another person that I don't know. This is just weird, I wouldn't really suggest it as an intro tactic.

I sent an email blast to a bunch of our portfolio founders asking to catch up and also 'update them on the future of our fund'. Multiple founders assumed the firm was blowing up and wrote back concerned. Ha, nope. Just wanted to say hi!

While I was hoping the VC market would pick-up and provide some consistency for founders, it has not. I'm puzzled why some deals are getting done at a record pace and others are stuck? This is true across verticals, geographies and founder experience. It's a finicky market out there, hang on founder friends!

I see a bunch of founders now put their pitch decks in their Twitter / LI profiles (using Docsend). Seems clever and to the point. Aside from soliciting issues, I don't hate it. Thoughts?

Later stage startups are once again optimistic about growing! It's been 2 yrs since I've heard such confidence / excitement around growth metrics for the coming year. Caught up with 6 portfolio founders today (series B / C) - the energy was high and projection (4x!) were‚Ä¶

Founder just called, closed an $800k contract last night. Been working on it for 2 years. Company has runway just thru Jan. We all thought it was over. My kinda New Year's Eve startup miracle üí™üèº

Founder just called, closed an $800k contract last night. Been working on it for 2 years. Company has runway just thru Jan. We all thought it was over. My kinda New Year's Eve startup miracle.

I met a startup founder I really liked today! He's raising a pre-seed with half committed. High energy, fintech, sensible valuation, good metrics. Felt weird to propose the next call on Jan 6th so what do I do?

Fascinating to hear just how bullish US based tech people are about 2025 whereas outside the US the predictions are doom and gloom for the whole world. Total disconnect.

Name an investment bank geared towards entrepreneurs where the partners are NOT wearing suits on the website? I'm predicting a big 2025 and have some portfolio company founders looking for just this‚Ä¶

Everyone seems to agree (and the data supports) that the best small funds out-perform the big ones. But everyone also asks why I don't raise a bigger fund?

If you run a Slack community on a free plan, listen up‚Ä¶ I had a melt down today when a member of our 1000 person slack, NOT an admin, was able to upgrade us to a paid plan. This cost $7.5 (per month) and was charged to his CC. Then I received the receipt with all his details and‚Ä¶

Half the VCs I know think deal flow quality is low right now with mostly derivative products. The other half think it's amazing with AI fostering exponential innovation. I'm right down the middle‚Ä¶quality seems good, prices reasonable, founders moving fast but not seeing tons of‚Ä¶

2 weeks ago, a founder received a term sheet from a 'reputable' VC to lead a round. The VC made a bunch of intros to other investors to fill the rest. The founder got a lots of nos from those intros. This must have freaked the VC so today, he pulled the term sheet. THIS IS LAME!

If investors are still bearish on CPG, just pitch your startup as supply chain and digital manufacturing instead. Works every time!

If investors are still bearish on consumer, just pitch your startup as proprietary data and analytics instead. Works every time!

There are two ways to succeed at a big company. Be liked or be unique. Likable people fit in and don't make waves. Unique people stick out, are bold and do their own thing. Both paths can succeed, just know which game you're playing.

Looked thru the cap tables of all our 250 investments to identify the most active pre-seed investors. While most early stage investors claim to do pre-seed, I think the real number is 20 funds across the US. That's a small number.

Catching up with tech folks in Australia this week and feels like the US did 12 months ago. Lots of skepticism around venture. Met with 6 venture funds, 12 founders and folks at Canva, Google, Goldman. Market is tight here for startups but even harder for emerging fund managers. Family offices have fled to PE / credit. Stay strong friends, things will improve soon I predict.

For many years my lawyer friends refused to talk to me about legal tech startups or any innovation across the legal tech stack. And then, AI scared the pants off of them and they became believers - proactively reaching out about new tech products. Incredible to see an industry and mentality shift so fast!

One of the most undervalued founder characteristics is attention to detail. Everyone talks about vision, but founders focused on the details don't run out of money, are in the weeds when it comes to product and customer feedback. Basically - they sweat the small stuff.

Startup went out to raise a $2m pre-seed, pre product. Didn't happen so they raised $500k instead. Took a year to get to market and just signed a big customer. Looking back the team is really happy that they didn't raise the $2m despite being cash strapped. They all agree that they would have spent the money faster than they should.

A pre-seed company that raises a modest round should not be burning more than $50k per month. This is a hill that I'm willing to die on.

I know so many pre-seed funded startup with $100-250k ARR and 6 months of runway that are unable to raise a seed round. Insiders are being tapped but many are unable to help. I'm worried about this cohort of companies unless things really open up in January.

Ironically, despite all the doom and gloom about the venture capital model and lack of liquidity, I returned more capital to LPs in 2024 than any other year except 2021 (I've been investing for a decade now). 1 x M&A in November and 1 x secondary in September.

Caught up with 3 high net worth individual investors last week who typically invest directly into startups and also into VC funds. All come from founder backgrounds. All mentioned that they are now only focused on classic Private Equity opportunities. Wow - what is happening?

Picked up my new passport today, feels like a good moment to go EVERYWHERE‚Ä¶

Cold email from a Tier 1, Bay Area series A/B investor that I don't know: "Hey Jenny, I want to mark-up your deals. Let's connect on my trip to NYC later next month." Hmm, kinda weird but also points for being direct!

My executive coach fired me after a couple of months. He said the things I'm trying to change have actually served me well / helped me get to where I am today‚Ä¶ So instead he suggested that I get a shrink to get comfortable being me.

Investor diligencing a company connects the founder to a potential customer for feedback. Founder closes the customer AND signs a competing term sheet with a different VC. Good reminder that all is fair in love and fundraising.

Despite this being an exceptionally tough time to raise a first time venture fund, I get inbound from 1-2 aspiring managers each week who want advice on how to get started. I think it's great and I always encourage them to go for it. It's a magical industry, we need all the true believers we can get!

Dear founder friends,

The window to raise capital in 2024 is almost closed. A couple more weeks and then investors move into finish-up mode and then into holiday party mode. Never mind all the VCs claiming to be open for biz in December. That's called marketing. Push hard to get your rounds closed now!

Caught up with an early stage founder this weekend building an AI native company in NYC. Had significant interest from VCs but decided to take family office cash instead. Only wants long term thinking capital involved. Wondering if this becomes a new trend with founders?

Tough convo w/ a founder friend‚Ä¶.new startup idea not super innovative nor differentiated enough. He pushed back and tried to convince me. Days later‚Ä¶ a new pitch and concept! Investors, team and customers are all super excited. I'll invest in these types of founders all day long - fast moving and data driven.

Attended a conference last week where many of the VCs / LPs claimed that traditional venture is dead (or some variation of that). I left before the happy hour, way too depressing to stick around. Despite the current down turn, I'm optimist about the future of this business.

If you're a founder pitching on Zoom, remember that you likely seem way less animated and distant than IRL. So grab some charisma, a big smile and a brightly colored shirt and have some fun during the pitch! Works like a charm to get the second meeting.

Y'all have strong opinions about pre-seed founders who have EAs to help them schedule? Just checking‚Ä¶

Humbling week (and it's only Monday) dealing with 2 recap financings. Investing and supporting founders is only part of this job. Managing the portfolio in tough times is the real challenge of venture.

Had a run-in with sharp elbowed seed investor a few months ago. Now he's asking for intros to a couple of our pre-seed companies. Not sure what planet this guy is on to think that I'm going help him? Geez.

Big multi-stage venture capital funds shutting down their growth groups is actually good news for early stage founders. It means more capital and attention refocused in the early stage where the support really matters.

Met with a family office LP today and he asked about my 'breakout' companies from our 2022 pre-seed fund. I told him: We don't have any breakouts, our job is to help keep these companies alive until they find P/M fit. The LP seemed shocked. Think he writes me a check?

Not sure I get the obsession over repeat founders? While in my experience it's true that serial founders raise more money faster, it's unclear that these founders have a higher hit rate than first time entrepreneurs. Love those first time founders, I'll invest in them all day long.

A bunch of companies I know went to market raising $5M seed rounds thinking that having a great team building in AI would be enough to get the big west coast funds interested. But turns out that metrics matter and they are all rethinking this strategy. Really like these companies but feels premature for a large seed.

If you have 9 months of runway, do you hustle to raise capital now before the Thanksgiving slow down or wait until January when you will only 6 months left? This came up a couple of times this week with founders I was speaking to. Seasonal timing is really a thing.

Funny when people think I work in finance. Being an early stage VC is much more like being a shrink, football coach or chef than being a finance bro.

"No breakfast is the new Power Breakfast" - guy at the next table with a glass of water, Crosby Street hotel.

One lesson I learned the hard way as a founder is that most investors make-up their minds in the first couple of minutes of a pitch. You can spend endless follow up meetings trying to convince them but it's often an uphill battle. Much easier to fill the top of the funnel with...

I absolutely love teaching. It's the unexpected joy of my life. I absolutely hate turning down students when they pitch me their shiny new startups. It's the hardest thing to do after all the encouragement I've given them.

Ouch - just cleaned up my VC investor CRM and took out 20 funds that are no longer deploying. It's rough out there and I'm bummed to see some of these funds go away. Not great for founders.

I used to be skeptical about the people leaving big tech to build startups. But after a couple days back in SF, some of the x-Google / FB people I met seem ready to really grind. Clearly, time will tell but they were all fired up to be involved in the next wave of innovation.

I met Bill Gross on Twitter‚Ä¶ As a long time fan of Idea Lab, I was thrilled when one day, Bill responded to one of my posts. Then he shared some deals with me - and now I'm investing into one of his companies. Yesterday, I visited Idea Lab in Pasadena and met Bill in person for the first time. Turns out that we share a favorite artist and painting. The world can be unexpected and magical - a great reminder to put yourself out there.

Principals at VC funds are some of my favorite people to work with. Still hungry, humble and grinding AND they also have check writing ability. Perfect combo. Just met with a few awesome LA and SF based Principals today and I'm excited for the next gen that will take over their firms soon enough!

Pro tip if you're a founder fundraising: Set up in Madison Square Park any sunny day this month and 10 top VCs will cross your path. I ran into 3 today as I was walking thru.

The fall fundraising season has officially kicked off. In my opinion, this is the best 10 weeks of the year for startups to raise capital. Investors are fresh from the summer and many are now behind on deployment pace. Founder friends, run at it hard and get the money!

5 days in Latam meeting local founders, VCs, LPs and I noticed that everyone I met lives in two places and carries two passports: Panama + Miami, Colombia + Miami, Venezuela + Madrid, Guatemala + Austin, Mexico + NYC‚Ä¶ A prepared mind + body, ready to be where they need to be.

Just boarded a flight to Central America without my wallet. Went to the airport with only my passport and phone. I've gotten so used to digital wallets that I totally forgot. Wish me luck!

We closed 12 deals this summer and the average age of the founders was 40. Feels like a dramatic shift upward. So are all the recent college grads back to banking?

I'm hosting an AI founders dinner in September and we actually need more men to keep the ratio even-ish. Gotta love NYC tech.

I zoomed with a founder at his (fancy) house in The Hamptons. He'd been a successful exec before but this is his first startup. I asked if he considered bootstrapping instead? He looked surprised. No idea why you'd want to raise outside capital if you didn't have to?

We closed 4 deals in June, 4 in July and 2 in August. But we have 9 days left in the month so anything can happen‚Ä¶

Europeans are tough. None of my friends in Italy or France have AC in their homes. In Geneva you must have a "valid reason" to purchase AC, such as a health condition. Americans would last 10 minutes there.

I have 5 promising portfolio companies raising follow-on rounds now. I can only manage to invest in 1 of them. What do I do?

One of our portfolio companies is raising a bridge round. Insider investor gave terms with a 2x liquidation pref. We committed to the bridge if they remove the liq pref. The founders + other investors were surprised at our response. Let's see what happens next, stay tuned! UPDATE: All investors agreed to kill the liq pref and now the bridge is over subscribed. May even turn into a real round. Closing next Friday. I hear everyone who called out this being a risky strategy. It was.

Portfolio co is closing a $10m round, they are $200k short and the lead investor won't let them close. This is super annoying. UPDATE: Huge thank you to everyone who messaged me to help. The round is now oversubscribed.

If you can't get an early stage investor over the line in a reasonable amount of time, stop trying. Instead, fill the top of the funnel with more qualified investors. There are so many of them out there. Dig around to find even more!

The Olympics are like startups‚Ä¶ most won't make it and the ones that do will suffer along the way.

When the founders you back are the same founders who back your fund AND you get to have an amazing lunch in Barcelona together where they are based, it's a great day!

June was one of our busiest months on record, 5 deals closed. July looking like a banger as well. Deal flow is epic, prices at pre-seed have come down a tad and founders are fired up. Lots of gov tech, security and infra - the sexy stuff we love.

Investors love product demos. But I notice that most founders don't show a demo during a pitch / first meeting unless asked. This is a mistake. We love demos so much that after the meeting, follow up with a Loom video of the demo. Simple and super effective.

Ran the numbers‚Ä¶ Portfolio of 300 startups and only 5 founder breakups. Way lower than I would have expected. Way to go cofounders.

Startups are strongly divided into the have and have-nots right now. One of our portfolio companies just breezed thru a $5m Seed raise with $2M from the pre-seed still in the bank. Product not live yet, no revenue or customers. Such strange times. Feels unfair and unpredictable.

I get hundreds of LinkedIn connection requests each day from people I don't know with no note or context provided. Most are founders or working in tech. This is strange behavior to me but seems to have been totally normalized. IDK, maybe they are just using LI differently, someone please explain!

Received 130 investor updates from our portfolio companies for this quarter. It's only July 3‚Ä¶ No better indicator of a recovery than founders excited to send updates and share good news.

Caught up with a French founder in Paris today. He's thinking about leaving the country based on the gloomy election sentiment. Same feeling in the US. Some of the best and brightest talent are not planning to stick around. I'm just curious though‚Ä¶where is everyone going??

I cohosted an event with a big tech company. It was a simple lunch for 50 but required 30 emails, 2 spreadsheets, 1 prep call and 10 people planning. This is why big companies fail - they forget that they were once scrappy startups. This type of over-engineering of small things kills momentum.

Absolute best park in the world for a walk and talk on a hot and sunny London day. Caught up with a few early stage founders in London today. All planning to head to the US to fundraise. I advised against it. The market is also tough in the US right now and little incentive for local VCs to look internationally. Plus‚Ä¶ all the US VCs are vacationing in Italy this summer anyway.

I love the optimism of this data so I'm staying positive! But I'm actually seeing the opposite in my portfolio and across early stage companies that I know‚Ä¶ way more Seed rounds getting done now and still crazy hard to raise Series A.

Caught up with a founder I backed 8 years ago. At first, the company's industrial vertical focus was hot, then very very not hot, and now hot again. Recently closed $30M and has a shot at becoming a dominant player. Many on the cap table gave up on this one, I'm glad I didn't.

SF is definitely coming back! It's taken some time and there's still work to do but the city is alive and thriving in so many ways. It was hard to watch the rapid decline over the past years but things are looking up in my second favorite city on earth.

A top-tier Seed fund VC said that his best performing companies never needed or asked for his help fundraising - at any stage. So, that made me look at my own portfolio‚Ä¶ 70% of my top companies (including 5 unicorns) needed help and 30% did not.

The best deal that I've been sent recently is from a founder who I passed on. Now you think I'm going to say that we stayed in touch or I was helpful in some way. But nope, not that. He just thought that I was quick to say no and would treat his founder friend the same way (although I said yes this time!)

When two different companies in your portfolio pivot into the same concept, it's messy for everyone. These started as very different companies. Yes, we keep all info confidential but honestly, it's tough to support both emotionally.

Quality at NY Tech Week is super high this year. At our pre-seed founder breakfast, I met 8 founders that I'm interested in following up with. Events can be a lot of work but top of the funnel is on fire right now.

I'm now warning founders that the election cycle this fall may impact their ability to fundraise during that time. Typically, Sept‚ÄìNov is one of the best fundraising windows - but maybe not this year‚Ä¶ What do you think?

One thing that took me a while to figure out is that just because a person is nice / friendly / agreeable, doesn't mean that they are open to feedback.

If you had to guess‚Ä¶ what percent of VCs who claim to use a suite of AI tools in their workflow / sourcing / marketing are really just using ChatGPT? I'd say 95%‚Ä¶

Last week, I provided a graphic description to my team (men) of my experience getting a mammogram. As I described my breast being maneuvered onto a plastic tray and then pressed in a vice so tight that I almost passed out, the guys' jaws dropped, they looked stunned - followed by them furiously googling this torture device. This is why I invest in women's health companies. While I'm grateful that I have access to this lifesaving technology, I know that we can do better. So, who is working on next-gen breast cancer solutions?

The kindest thing you can do for a founder is tell them directly if his/her pitch sucks. Someone did that for me once and it changed everything.

The Series A cliff is real! There's a huge backlog of seed stage companies with nice traction - just not $3m ARR + 30% MOM growth kinda traction. Wonder why more people aren't speaking about this? It's a huge bummer and something's gotta give.

A well known VC just told me that I'm not even running a pre-seed fund strategy but rather an angel fund. My check size is $200k and the average round I'm investing into is $1m. Do I need to rebrand yet again? What do you think?

About a year ago, one of the best / most prolific pre-seed investors told me that he started writing bigger checks because he had to - it was just too hard to find enough small ticket investors like me to fill up the rounds. I was skeptical but now I think he's absolutely right.

Founder friends: Emailing a VC your financials is the fastest way to get an investor to say NO. Instead, consider setting up a 20-minute Zoom to walk the investor through your model (screen share) and talk through your thinking and assumptions. This builds trust and rapport.

The best part about having founders as your LPs is they are the most supportive and encouraging group. The worst part about having mostly founders as LPs is that many are also going through tough times in this wonky market.

If you're a founder choosing between a term sheet with structure or a down round‚Ä¶ Probably want to take the down round. Long term success over short term pain. Problem is that I've just walked a few founders through this thinking and they all hated the down round concept.

I invested in a founder who eats dog treats. Is that hard core enough for ya? (Yes, her startup makes the treats.)

Signaling risk is real so let's stop pretending it's not. Taking pre-seed money from a series A fund can cause issues when you try to raise the next round. If everything is going great, nothing to worry about. During ZIRP, nothing to worry about. Today, it's a real risk.

Today, I worked on updating my investor CRM. It's big as you can imagine but it's not growing much anymore. If there's anything positive about the tech slowdown, it's that we can all finally catch up on who is who in VC and my CRM is up to date (ish).

I interviewed 12 very successful founders about how they developed leadership skills. The answers surprised me‚Ä¶ Nope, not HBS, McKinsey or training programs. The answer was that they had to organize volunteers at a young age. Some led church groups, student orgs, local activism, science fairs or local sports teams. All had to get other people to do things without any real authority and no comp.

Just checked our Airtable. We have 37 companies in market right now raising capital. VC friends at all stages and verticals, you've been warned, you'll be hearing from me.

Come to think of it‚Ä¶ I've never lost a deal to a founder I've met with in person. Maybe virtual isn't so great after all.

I invested in company through a Roll Up Vehicle (RUV) and got completely screwed. Totally my fault of course - nothing to do with the RUV administrators. If you're thinking about investing into one to make it easier for the founder, call me.

Since everyone is DMing me! The person who administers the RUV can waive the rights of the people in it. And guess who is administering it???

One of my favorite lawyers at a big fancy firm just got a venture round done for only $5k. Nature is healing.

Hard enough to career transition into VC from another industry but expecting similar cash comp is unrealistic. Most people I talk to are coming from big companies, big tech, law, banking, consulting etc where the salaries are high across the board. Something has to give‚Ä¶

$10m Safe rounds happening because investors are reluctant to price the round. This doesn't feel healthy or sustainable. Who can explain what's happening here? To be clear, a $10m round using a Safe not priced instrument.

Now is a great time to start a business but not for the reasons everyone talks about‚Ä¶ In this market the opportunity cost is low. If you don't find PMF in 18‚Äì24 months, you'll go under quickly and can move on.

Closed two deals this week (1 sales automation + 1 Latam fintech) and it's only Monday. Let's see what the rest of the week brings‚Ä¶
